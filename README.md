This repo is now public based on a comment on the Youtube video I published highlighting this work.

The Youtube video is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNgUOCCwp3g&lc=UgwsSSCkCzewJNNHC2x4AaABAg

I have not touched this repo in years, but below is an outline of how it worked.

## Overview
This repo uses Unity, and a Python implementation of the NEAT RL algorithm.

Unity is used for the game engine, Python is used for the NEAT algorithm, and data is passed between the two using a text file.
